# i2QTL-SV-STR-analysis 
Code used to process and analyze structural variation (SVs) and short tandem repeat variation (STRs) as part of the i2QTL Consortium. Variants were identified in 719 deeply sequenced whole genomes combining data from two large iPSC collections, iPSCORE (Frazer lab) and HipSci. 

# Notebooks
This directory generally contains ipython notebooks for analysis and processing/exploration of data when sharable

# Notebooks/Figures
This directory contains code to generate Figures this study

# Scripts
This notebook contains ipynb and and .py python scripts developed during the project to process variants 


# djPyi2
This is a python package that I made to help with this project, and has some useful functions. Code will not be runnable without this package.
